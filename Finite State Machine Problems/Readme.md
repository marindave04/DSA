A Finite State Machine (FSM) problem is a problem where the solution depends on tracking a limited number of states and moving between them based on inputs or conditions.

🔹 What “finite” means

The system has a fixed, small number of states

You are always in exactly one state at a time

You move to another state only by defined rules

🔹 Core components of an FSM

States – possible modes the system can be in

Input / condition – what you observe at each step

Transitions – rules that say from state A, go to state B

Start state

(Optional) Accept / final states

🔹 FSM problems in coding interviews

These problems usually:

Scan the array/string once

Maintain a current state

Change state when a condition is met

Accept/reject or compute something based on final state
